Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Pedram Taheri**, a tech enthusiast with over 8 years of experience in the software engineering world. Currently, Iâ€™m the Director of Engineering at **Offerland**, a Canadian startup in the real estate automation space. I lead a talented team of 10 engineers, and together, we build innovative solutions to simplify real estate valuation and appraisal for our customers.

## My Journey

I've been fortunate to work with amazing people on impactful projects:

- **Offerland (2024 - Present)**
  At Offerland, I oversee the entire engineering team, guiding our tech strategy, fostering collaboration, and ensuring we deliver impactful solutions. Itâ€™s an exciting space to innovate in, and I love the fast-paced, high-stakes environment of startups.

- **Divar (2023-2024)**
  I led 12 engineers across 4 teams to create Pay-Per-Click revenue streams and build stable payment services. Along the way, I authored best practices for Python and Golang that unified the developer experience across teams.

- **Cafe Bazaar(2017-20223)**
  I worked my way up from a Jr. Software Engineer to Director of Engineering, Advertisement, managing cross-functional teams and delivering projects like a low-latency stream processing pipeline and a real-time CTR estimation microservice. These systems powered significant revenue growth and improved system scalability.

Throughout my journey, I've worn many hats: software engineer, technical team leader, and now a director. Each role has taught me invaluable lessons about tech, leadership, and the importance of nurturing great teams.

## Beyond Work

When Iâ€™m not leading engineering teams, I enjoy exploring the latest in tech, reading about system design (big fan of Designing Data-Intensive Applications), and staying fit with strength and hypertrophy training.

Iâ€™m also deeply intrigued by philosophy, especially existentialism, absurdism, and altruism. I find it fascinating to explore questions about meaning, purpose, and how we can create positive impacts in the lives of others. These philosophical frameworks inspire not just my personal reflections but also how I approach leadership and decision-making in my career.

Additionally, I dabble in content creation as I work on sharing my experiences and insights with the community.

## Letâ€™s Connect

Iâ€™m passionate about technology, team building, and making a meaningful impact through my work. Whether you want to talk about tech, leadership, or absurdism, feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
